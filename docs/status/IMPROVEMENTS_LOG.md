# Status Reporting Improvements

## Changes Made (October 6, 2025)

### 1. Smart Audit Filtering ✅

**Problem:** Audit flagged all 4 API calls in `places.ts` as "direct usage" warnings, even though this is the implementation itself.

**Solution:**
- Modified `scan_places.js` to separate "implementation" from "direct usage"
- Now filters `services/google/places.ts` into separate category
- Only warns about direct usage OUTSIDE the centralized service

**Result:**
```bash
Before:
  Direct API usage (needs migration): 4 ⚠️
  
After:
  Implementation (places.ts): 4 ✅
  Direct API usage (needs migration): 0
  ✅ All API usage goes through centralized service!
```

### 2. PR Summary Generator ✅

**Added:** `npm run status:pr`

**What it does:**
- Runs audit
- Updates README
- Generates `PR_SUMMARY_GENERATED.md` with:
  - Cost impact summary
  - Technical changes overview
  - Files changed breakdown
  - Testing checklist
  - Monitoring instructions
  - Documentation links

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run status:pr
# Outputs PR description to console + file
# Copy/paste into GitHub PR
```

**Output includes:**
- Cost reduction estimates ($69→$10/day)
- Technical implementation details
- Testing checklist for reviewers
- Post-deployment monitoring steps

---

### 3. Screenshot Placeholder System ✅

**Added:** `npm run status:screens:placeholder`

**Problem:** Automated screenshots require Playwright (not installed by default)

**Solution:**
- Creates manual screenshot instructions
- Generates `docs/status/screenshots/INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Includes step-by-step capture guide
- Checklist for 4 required screenshots

**Files created:**
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed capture steps
- `README.md` - Screenshot checklist

**Fallback workflow:**
```bash
# If Playwright not installed
npm run status:screens:placeholder

# Follow instructions to capture:
# 1. Home (/)
# 2. Explore (/explore)
# 3. Place Hub (/place/:id)
# 4. List View (/list/:id)

# Then update status
npm run status:update
```
