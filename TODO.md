## Phase 2: Geolocation & Intelligent Content Association

- [ ] **Core Geolocation & Map Integration:**
    - [ ] Integrate a map library (like Google Maps or Leaflet) into a new `Map.tsx` page.
    - [ ] Fetch and display the user's saved places and lists on the map.
    - [ ] Implement basic map interactions (panning, zooming, clicking on a pin to see a pop-up with a link to the Hub/List).

- [ ] **Automatic Hub Association from Photos:**
    - [ ] **EXIF Data Extraction:** When a user uploads a photo in `CreatePost.tsx`, extract GPS coordinates from the image's EXIF data.
    - [ ] **Reverse Geocoding:** Use a service (like Google's Geocoding API) to convert those coordinates into a potential address or place name.
    - [ ] **Hub Matching Algorithm:**
        - [ ] Query your Firebase `hubs` collection for hubs near the photo's location.
        - [ ] Present the user with a list of potential hubs to associate the post with, with the most likely match pre-selected.
        - [ ] Allow the user to confirm or search for a different hub.

- [ ] **Screenshot-based Hub Association:**
    - [ ] **Image Analysis:** When a user uploads a screenshot, use a cloud vision API (like Google Cloud Vision) to perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and logo detection.
    - [ ] **Intelligent Search:** Use the extracted text (place name, address, etc.) to perform a targeted search against your `hubs` collection and the Google Places API.
    - [ ] **User Confirmation:** Just like with the photo location, present the user with the most likely hub and allow them to confirm.

## Phase 3: Advanced Algorithms & AI-Powered Features

- [ ] **Location-Aware Discovery Algorithm:**
    - [ ] Modify `discoveryAlgorithm.ts` to factor in:
        - [ ] The user's current location (if shared).
        - [ ] The locations associated with the user's lists.
        - [ ] The locations of the user's saved places.
    - [ ] The algorithm should now recommend a mix of content based on user preferences and what's geographically relevant.

- [ ] **AI-Generated Hub Descriptions:**
    - [ ] Create a new cloud function (in `functions/src`) that triggers when a new post is added to a hub.
    - [ ] **Content Aggregation:** The function will gather text from all posts within that hub.
    - [ ] **AI Summarization:** Pass the aggregated text to a generative AI model (like Gemini) to create a concise, engaging summary for the hub's description.
    - [ ] **Google Maps Fallback:** If a hub has no posts, the function will fetch its description from the Google Places API and use that instead.

- [ ] **Import Lists from Google Maps:**
    - [ ] **Authentication & Permissions:** Use Firebase Authentication to securely connect to a user's Google account and request permission to access their Google Maps lists.
    - [ ] **Data Parsing:** Fetch the user's public or specified Google Maps lists and parse the place data.
    - [ ] **List Creation Flow:** For each imported list, create a new list in your app. For each place in the Google Maps list, either find a matching hub in your database or create a new one.
    - [ ] **User Review:** Allow the user to review the imported lists and places before finalizing the import.

- [ ] **"Influences" Algorithm:**
    - [ ] Define the metrics that contribute to a user's influence score (e.g., number of followers, likes received, saves on their posts/lists).
    - [ ] Create a cloud function that periodically calculates and updates the `influences` score for each user.
    - [ ] Display the influence score on user profiles.

## Phase 4: Collaboration & Social Features

- [ ] **Collaborative Lists:**
    - [ ] Allow multiple users to have admin/editor access to a single list.
    - [ ] Develop a system for inviting collaborators.
    - [ ] Implement granular permissions (e.g., view only, can add places, can edit list details).
